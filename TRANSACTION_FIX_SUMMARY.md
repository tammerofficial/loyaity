# Transaction Type Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. SQL Constraint Violation Error
**Error**: `SQLSTATE[23000]: Integrity constraint violation: 19 CHECK constraint failed: type`

**Root Cause**: The `transactions` table has an enum constraint that only allows:
- `'earned'`
- `'redeemed'` 
- `'expired'`
- `'adjusted'`

But the code was trying to insert:
- `'earn'` (missing 'ed' suffix)
- `'redeem'` (missing 'ed' suffix)

### 2. Missing Statistics View
**Error**: `View [admin.wallet-management.statistics] not found`

**Root Cause**: The `WalletManagementController@bridgeStatistics` method was trying to return a view that didn't exist.

## Files Modified

### 1. `app/Services/WalletBridgeService.php`
**Lines 107-113**: Fixed transaction type from `'earn'` to `'earned'`
```php
// Before
Transaction::create([
    'customer_id' => $customer->id,
    'type' => 'earn',  // ❌ Invalid
    'points' => $points,
    'description' => $reason,
    'balance' => $newPoints  // ❌ Field doesn't exist
]);

// After
Transaction::create([
    'customer_id' => $customer->id,
    'type' => 'earned',  // ✅ Valid
    'points' => $points,
    'description' => $reason
]);
```

**Lines 158-164**: Fixed transaction type from `'redeem'` to `'redeemed'`
```php
// Before
Transaction::create([
    'customer_id' => $customer->id,
    'type' => 'redeem',  // ❌ Invalid
    'points' => -$points,
    'description' => $reason,
    'balance' => $newPoints  // ❌ Field doesn't exist
]);

// After
Transaction::create([
    'customer_id' => $customer->id,
    'type' => 'redeemed',  // ✅ Valid
    'points' => -$points,
    'description' => $reason
]);
```

### 2. `resources/views/admin/wallet-management/statistics.blade.php`
**Created**: New statistics view with:
- Bridge status indicators
- Connection test results
- Bridge information display
- Bridge logs table
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## Testing

Created and ran a test script that successfully:
- ✅ Created transaction with type `'earned'`
- ✅ Created transaction with type `'redeemed'`
- ✅ Created transaction with type `'adjusted'`

## Result

Both issues have been resolved:
1. **Transaction type constraint violation**: Fixed by using correct enum values
2. **Missing statistics view**: Created the required view file

The wallet management system should now work correctly without SQL constraint violations.
